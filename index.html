            <h1>The Akan Name generator</h1>
            <p>This is a web application that takes your birthday details and calculates the day of the week you were born and then
                depending on your gender, outputs your Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
                children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day of the week they were born.</p>
